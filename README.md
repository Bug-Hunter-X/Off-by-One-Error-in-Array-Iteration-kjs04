This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from incorrectly using `<=` in the loop condition, leading to an attempt to access an element beyond the array's bounds. This example highlights the importance of careful array index management in Java.
